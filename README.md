# Mini Poker Game with Intelligent AI
This project is a 3-card poker game with an AI opponent that’s designed to generate positive revenue over time. The AI is built to "cheat" intelligently without blatantly winning every round, making it difficult for the user to detect any unfair advantage. This README provides an overview of the project, including game rules, functionality, and features of the AI system.

## Game Overview
This is a simple "mini poker" game, where the player competes against an AI opponent with strategic decision-making abilities. The AI is designed to increase revenue for the computer while playing in a way that doesn’t arouse suspicion from the player. The game interface is user-friendly and suitable for anyone familiar with basic poker rules.

## Rules and Gameplay
Type of Game: 3-Card Poker

Possible Hands (weakest to strongest): Pair < Flush < Straight < Triple < Straight-Flush

### Game Flow:
1, User places a bet.

2, Three cards are dealt to both the user and the computer:
 - Two face up
 - One face down

3, Betting rounds take place:
User can raise or pass

4, AI can match the user’s raise, raise further, or fold
The final (face-down) cards are revealed, and the winner is decided based on hand ranking.

## Features
**Intelligent AI**: The AI is designed to make calculated decisions, ensuring the computer generates revenue over time.

**Randomized Play**: The AI’s strategy changes, making it resistant to simple patterns, so it’s not easily detectable by users.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for ease of use.

**Game Logging**: Keeps track of the win-loss history, which the AI uses to adjust its strategy.
